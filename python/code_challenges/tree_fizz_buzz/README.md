## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
time is O(n) since I dont know how big the tree is
space is O(n) since I dont know how much space is needed

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
