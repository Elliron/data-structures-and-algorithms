## Challenge
Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue

## Approach & Efficiency
I started by looking at different sources online and reading more about stacks and queues.
I then found a page that fit closer to my previous linked list code and compared the two.
I then wrote tests and functions.
I tested each function individually before continuing to the next test.

I repeated the process for Queue comparing it to both Linked List and Stacks.
