## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
My approach for this challenge was to take it slow.  I spent a lot of time white boarding and writing out my code on the board before opening VS studio.  As I am just learning Java I started by looking at each individual line to make sure my app was properly setup.  Once I had done all I could in my setup, I moved on to creating the array that I need to iterate over.  I then began looking into sorting the array, I found multiple options but was given the instruction to not use built in Java.  I chose the option that didn't use an import and then got TA(Teacher) assistant to clean up and ask questions about anything I wasn't sure about.
I am trying to make sure I dedicate focus on everything I do instead of speed completion.
